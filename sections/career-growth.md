## Competencies

At Bloom, we’ve documented expectations for each role — and for all Bloomers — by writing down what competencies, or skills, are most critical to our work. Each competency has 4 levels: Aware, Working, Proficient, and Expert.

Whatever your role at Bloom, we want it to be clear what we expect of you, as well as how you can grow. Each role carries specific competency and level expectations, and we check in annually to talk about how you can grow within your role or toward a new role.

Bloom’s current competencies include:

* [Core competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3oqU7SLxHu_vWho4gNycP8qx4cAIYKN7BhscHE5EfE/) (these apply to everyone at Bloom)
* [Product and delivery management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iMGuXLjahlCeyOyx65twOpvKMu20Z69H2GrO0NEnSY/)
* [Engineering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15B24Z7qR87FHJP87C442XEHy7zG6LHtD3GnCvHKR53Y/)

## Milestones and conversations

We aim to give feedback frequently, so we can all learn and grow continuously. You can expect to get feedback in regular 1:1s, Friday appreciation threads, project retros, and impromptu conversations. However, we also know that deeper feedback and more formal conversations can be really helpful for staying intentional about your career.


### 4-month calibration meeting

About 4 months after you start at Bloom, your manager will schedule an initial calibration conversation. They’ll reach out to a few folks you work with for feedback, and ask you to reflect on your work, what’s giving you energy, and whether it matches your expectations. The goal of this meeting is to start a dialogue about respective expectations and alignment and identify any course correction needed.

The 4-month calibration meeting also marks the start of ongoing conversations about [using your professional development benefit](/sections/pay-and-benefits/#professional-development).

### Annual 360 feedback

Every year, you and your manager will each assess your role competencies, including which ones you’re confident in and which feel like a stretch. We’ll also gather feedback from 2-3 coworkers who’ve seen your work closely or collaborated with you on project work. Then, you'll have a conversation together to discuss your assessments. Finally, your manager will provide the final assessment and suggest professional development goals for the coming year.

In general, annual feedback is also when we take the opportunity to discuss promotions and raises (beyond cost-of-living increases), if needed.


### If there are issues with your performance

If your performance isn’t meeting our expectations for your role (as documented in your job description and relevant competencies), we will tell you as quickly and clearly as we can. If your performance or skill level is putting your job at risk, your manager will clearly document the competency levels needed to stay in your role, as well as a timeline for improving performance. This process is known as a performance improvement plan (PIP).
We do our best to raise performance issues before they become serious enough to put your job at risk — whenever possible, we want to see folks grow and succeed in their roles.

To see what a Performance Improvement Plan often looks like, see our [Perfomance Improvement Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d35Onw2tVrYqqqNCa0Va0ujocAdQrcgTbKt72HST4VE/).
