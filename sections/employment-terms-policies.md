## At-will notice

Your employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of Bloom and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. 

Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Guidebook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy.

Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Handbook with the exception of the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).


## Equal employment

Bloom provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. 

We take allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.


## Reasonable accommodations

It is Bloom’s policy to comply with all relevant and applicable provisions of the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/), the [Accessible Canada Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-0.6/page-1.html), and any regional laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. 

Bloom will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person's physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.

Employees who become disabled should notify People Ops if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause Bloom undue hardship.


## Employment classifications

**Salaried employees:** This is when we bring someone on as a salaried member of the team to work on projects (internal and external). As a salaried employee, we have a duty to help you grow in your career, and you have a duty to help shape Bloom as an organization and within your practice area. 

We expect full-time employees to bill 36 hours per week, leaving 10% time for internal Bloom time (like coffee chats outside project work, internal meetings, or professional development).

**Contractors**: This is when we bring someone on for specific, short-term and/or part-time support for a defined project (internal or external). As a contractor, you’re treated as your own business and are more self-sufficient — you support your own career development and office setup. We don’t provide professional development support or coaching outside of project feedback. 

**Temporary employees**: This is when we bring someone on as a temporary employee to support project work with a relatively short time horizon (&lt; 9 months). As a temporary employee, you get a prorated salary, health benefits, and prorated PTO benefits. 

If the total time commitment is unclear, you can also be paid on an hourly basis, subject to the same prorated health benefits and PTO. We do not provide other benefits (like professional development or remote work stipends) until/unless you join as a salaried employee.

As a temporary employee, you operate much like a salaried employee. Outside of your project work, we want you to invest non-billable time to engage with and help grow Bloom and your practice area (for example, attend quarterly all-hands meetings). We’ll also provide more direct management than we do for contractors.

Note that Bloom employees do not qualify for overtime compensation. See our [time tracking](/sections/time-tracking/) section for more information.


## Background checks

Many of our clients require a background check, and we may hire third-party services to perform them.

Some work will require a [public trust determination](https://www.usajobs.gov/help/faq/job-announcement/security-clearances/) (sometimes called a clearance, but it’s more lightweight than that). We’ll tell you if you need one before you start your project.


## Immigration law compliance

🇺🇸 Employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. We need these documents as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed, and we’ll keep them in your confidential electronic personnel file.

At this time, we are unable to support visa sponsorship.

We use E-Verify,  a system that confirms your employment eligibility by comparing information we enter from your Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, to records available to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. Know your [rights as an employee](https://www.e-verify.gov/sites/default/files/everify/brochures/EVerifyKnowYourRightsBrochure.pdf) and check out [additional employee resources](https://www.e-verify.gov/employees/employee-resources). 

🇨🇦 Employees hired to work in Canada need to complete Remote.com's identity verification process. This will require proof of identity (passport, drivers licence, or other gov supplied ID card), Social Insurance Number, immigration/citizenship status (you must have a valid open work permit, permanent residency, or citizenship), and proof of bank account (like a voided cheque).

At this time, we are unable to support work permit sponsorship.


## Personnel (and personal) records

We maintain a secure electronic employment file while you are an employee. This file contains things like **🇺🇸**I-9s, **🇺🇸**a copy of I-9 identification, **🇺🇸**W-4s, Employment Agreements, and possibly other appropriate documents, on an individual basis. We use **🇺🇸**Gusto for U.S. employees and 🇨🇦Remote.com for Canadian employees.

Any personnel changes (such as [address](/sections/travel-and-relocation/#moving-(u.s.-and-beyond)), dependent changes) can be made directly in Gusto or Remote.


## Employee references

🇺🇸 We follow state and local regulations that govern employment references. In some cases, Bloom will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held in response to third parties inquiries.

🇨🇦 Remote.com can provide [employment verification letters](https://support.remote.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422684040461-How-to-generate-a-standard-employment-verification-letter-on-Remote). If something more is required, please discuss with your manager and/or People Ops.


## Workers' compensation

🇺🇸 Bloom provides insurance for all work-related injuries or illnesses. The name of Bloom's workers' compensation is Next Insurance / Amtrust, and pertinent information is available from People Ops if you need it. Next Insurance / Amtrust governs all insurance benefits provided by Bloom.

🇨🇦 Workers' compensation in Canada is a national program administered by provincial and territorial governments. Remote provides workers compensation insurance with all provinces.


## Compliance posters

Organizations are required by law to post compliance posters. No, we are not asking you to put these on your walls at home, so consider this space a digital wall for labor law compliance posters:
