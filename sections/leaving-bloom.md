title: Leaving Bloom
---

We would like Bloom to be a place where open dialogue can surface mismatched expectations, and both employees and management can seek to address issues together. We hope to make Bloom the best option for you, but in cases where we canâ€™t we want to create an amicable transition for you, for your coworkers, and for our future selves whenever our paths cross again.

# Types of separations
There are five ways a person can depart Bloom and they are handled with care and thoughtfulness. Most departures can feel sudden to folks who arenâ€™t directly involved and thatâ€™s because we deliberately keep the team of people dealing with the situation small. Usually, the team includes the personâ€™s manager, Ops, and other folks as needed. We do this to protect the privacy of current and past employees.
There is a process for each departure and there can be deviations based on the situation.

## Someone chooses to leave 
When someone resigns from Bloom, we work together on a timeline for sharing, and schedule an exit interview. We often encourage them to share this news themselves, and might offer guidance. 
We ask for a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of your intent to leave Bloom to your manager. 

## Performance-based departures
Many performance issues are addressed with rigorous feedback, but sometimes they result in departures.
We often offer additional support, and the employee is actively involved and aware on a multi-month timeline. 

## Code of conduct violations
When someone is terminated due to a [code of conduct violation](https://handbook.bloomworks.digital/sections/code-of-conduct/#violations), this means someone did something that violated our policies, and the trust and norms of the organization, or their colleagues. Similar to performance improvement, code of conduct violations only sometimes result in termination. These can take many different shapes and timelines, but we do acknowledge and start the process rather quickly to reduce harm.

## Layoffs
Layoffs happen when Bloom makes an organizational change and because of it can no longer find suitable work for an individual or group of individuals based on their specific skills. We share the business context for the change and offer severance and assistance in finding another role when applicable. 

## Termed employment ends
We try to find ways to keep termed folks on, but if there isnâ€™t any additional work for them, we end the term, but maintain a relationship in case other work that mutually works comes up. 

# Returning property

Any company or government property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment, or company credit cards, must be returned to Bloom at the time of separation.

# Terms upon employee departure

When you leave Bloom, you will be paid out unused accrued personal time. Respite leave and floating holidays will be forfeited.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Every state has different laws regarding your last paycheck. This [Gusto article](https://support.gusto.com/article/110807134100000/Dismiss-and-rehire-employees) ðŸ”’would be the best resource to find out what you need.


# Archiving your user accounts

If you resign from Bloom, we ask you to do some housekeeping on your way out. A few days before your last day, start the archiving process for Bloom software products. [Hereâ€™s a checklist to walk you through that process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-98LWKCu-lPevNYzjcdm7lw4-2tV6uBeIoronsTj9ro/edit?usp=sharing).
