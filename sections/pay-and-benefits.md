## Pay frequency

Bloom is on a semi-monthly payroll cycle, meaning you get paid twice per month (on the 15th and final day of each month). If payroll dates fall on a weekend or a holiday then paychecks process on the earlier business day. 

We use ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Gusto to administer payroll and benefits for U.S. employees, and ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Remote.com for Canadian employees. Gusto sends all payments via direct deposit (you could ask for a physical check, but itâ€™s not recommended) and you can access your detailed pay stubs online.

All salaried employees will receive a fixed COLA of $3,000 annually in the first week of February. Part-time employees will receive a COLA based on their FTE percentage. This flat-dollar approach ensures fairness and reflects the shared impact of living costs.

## Retirement savings (401k or RRSP)

Bloom matches 100% of retirement plan contributions up to 3% of your salary.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Guideline, our US 401k admin, will reach out to you directly to set up your account after you join Bloom. Our plan has a 3% match, regardless of contribution.

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Remote.com will provide instruction on enroling in an RRSP serviced by CanadaLife. During enrolment, you can adjust your contribution amount, but you should make sure that your contribution falls under the CRA maximum limit or tax penalties might apply.

Thereâ€™s no vesting period â€” all of our employees are automatically 100% vested from the start. 


## Healthcare

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ For U.S. based employees, Bloom covers 90% of medical plan premiums and up to 50% of premiums for dependents for the base plan. Our medical plan options are all through [UnitedHealthcare](https://www.uhc.com/). For detailed plan descriptions and cost estimates, reach out to People Ops.

Our health plans take on new members at the start of each calendar month following your start date. For example, if you join Bloom on June 15, your first date of coverage would be July 1.

_Note: Each year we select a plan (usually Gold tier) and calculate the employer contribution based on that cost. For instance, if our base plan costs USD $100/mo/per person, Bloom would contribute USD $90 for individuals and USD $50 for dependents. Someone can pick a more expensive plan (such as Platinum tier) that costs USD $200/mo/per person, but Bloom would still contribute USD $90/$50 to that premium._


## Vision, dental, disability, and life insurance

Bloom pays 99% of dental and vision premiums for employees, and 50% for dependents.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Vision, Dental, and Long-and Short-Term disability are provided by [Guardian](https://www.guardiandirect.com/). Bloom also provides $50,000 of life insurance for all employees at no cost to employees.

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Remote.com provides vision, dental, disability, and life insurance  through CanadaLife. See the [summary of benefits](https://remote.com/benefits-guide/employee-benefits-canada-health-standard-family) for more info.

If you have any additional questions regarding benefits, contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).


## Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ For employees who elect to have a flexible spending account (FSA), Bloom matches up to $250 of contributions annually.

## Remote work stipend

In your first year at Bloom, weâ€™ll reimburse up to USD $1,500 for items that make your home work environment effective, efficient, and comfortable.

Many people use this to [buy a new computer](/sections/your-first-few-weeks/#computer-and-equipment), get a monitor, or set up an ergonomic workspace. 

This does not include ongoing expenses like monthly internet, coworking spaces, coffee to drink at home, or aesthetic touches. This stipend renews after youâ€™ve been at Bloom for 3 years. Reach out to People Ops if you're not sure what your balance is.

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Since the tech stipend is a reimbursement of expenses, itâ€™s not subject to income tax in the United States.

After you purchase something, follow [expenses and reimbursement procedures](/sections/expenses-and-reimbursement/) to get reimbursed. 

Need suggestions on how to use your stipend? Bloomers have captured some recommendations [in this doc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pf4L1FK83dumIw3u9i-YEhmYBuAoM-TOFsDcYMuUl6E/edit?usp=sharing)


## Professional development

We reimburse up to USD $2,000 on professional development expenses for each full-time Bloomer each year. (If you are a part-time employee, your budget is prorated based on your working hours.)

In addition to the annual budget, we encourage Bloomers to pursue learning and growth during the workday, within the bounds of your billable hours goals. If your training or event doesnâ€™t allow you to make your billable hours for the week, run it by your manager.

If you need guidance on how much time is appropriate to spend on professional development, talk to your manager.


### Using your professional development budget

Youâ€™ll have access to your professional development budget after your 4 month calibration meeting with your manager. This budget can be used for a number of things:

* Online or in-person courses
* Testing fees & renewal costs associated with professional certifications
* Leadership coaching
* Other costs incurred becoming a smarter, more awesome version of you

For spending amounts over USD $50, you'll need to get approval in advance by sending an email to your manager and [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital). Include a brief explanation of how the expense is relevant to your role and professional development.

Professional development funds do not carry over at the end of the calendar year. So get busy learning something! And talk to your manager if you have professional development needs that go beyond your annual budget.
